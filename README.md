# odin-etch-a-sketch
Etch a sketch is simply an app for making doodles in the web browser. Choose and change grid size, erase your lines or remove grid to have a plain canvas if that is your preference. 
<p>I struggled really hard with nested loops and leveraging CSS Flex in this project but it paid off in future projects!</p>
